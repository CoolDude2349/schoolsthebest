Hello. This repo uses a service worker and a IndexedDB method to bring the math work offline. You'll have to visit the main index.html file first while online, so you can start the service worker. If service worker does not work, just use the IndexedDB storage. But you'll have to go to the link of the html file that you want and view it online first. It can be for a split second that you see the content and then it'll be saved to view offline. 

Avaliable math works:

- Eggy math
- Sm64
